Continuing on my series of solving the Euler problems in F#, here's the next one:

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
>
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
>
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Again, like the first problem, we can leverage the power of F# Sequences to make this problem trivial. I learned something new with this particular problem, and using unfold to create an infinite fibinocci sequence is pretty awesome:

    let answer = Seq.unfold (fun (a,b) -> Some( a+b, (b, a+b) ) ) (0,1) 
                    |> Seq.takeWhile(fun x -> x <= 4000000)
                    |> Seq.where(fun x -> x % 2 = 0)
                    |> Seq.sum

Pretty straight forward, create a fibinacci sequence, collect while the number is less than or equal to 4 million, filter out only the even numbers, and then total them all up.
