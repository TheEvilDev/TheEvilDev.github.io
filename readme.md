== TheEvilDev.github.io ==

This is the source code powering my personal website, http://blog.evildev.net.

In order to work with the code, you need the following dependencies installed:

	nodejs
	npm
	ruby 1.9.1
	jekyll

=== Working with the code ===

Once you've checked out the code, you need to run a couple of commands to pull in all the dependencies:

	# Install build tools, node dependencies
	npm install

	# Install javascript and css dependencies
	bower install

That's it.

=== Running the application ===

To run locally, simply run "grunt" from the root of the repository.
